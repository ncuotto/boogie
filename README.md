Control Spotify by dancing, check it out here: [Boogie online](https://ncuotto.github.io/boogie/)

## How it works
1. Click anywhere and move away from the camera view for a second or two. A snapshot of the background will be taken to subtract that from every frame.
2. The app tells you to come back and start dancing.
3. The pixels that are different from the background snapshot are counted along the x-axis. This histogram is plotted in the mini-view (top-right of the window). The maximum of this histogram is tracked over time, and using some number crunching we arrive at a BPM.
4. The BPM is used to query the Spotify web API for a song with the same BPM and maximum danceability âœ¨!
5. If you stop dancing, the music will stop and you can start dancing again for a new matching song.
